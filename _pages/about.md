My experience began from material synthesis (carbon nanotube fiber via floating catalyst method) and material analysis (morphology, structural arrangement, crystallinity and mechanical properties).

After that, I shifted to the in-situ TEM technique, which enables to investigate the variety of material's properties (ex. phase, crystallinity, composition) or process (ex. agglomeration, electrodeposition) related to environmental conditions (ex. temperature, gas pressure, electricity).

Additionally, I started python based image processing (ex. segmentation, edge detection) to extract more information from various electron microscopy data (ex. in-situ video, Tomography, 4D STEM).
