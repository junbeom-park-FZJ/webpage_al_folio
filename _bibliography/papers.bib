              The effects of sulfur on the size of iron catalyst particles and synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated during the direct spinning of CNT fibers. CNT fibers containing mainly double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) 5–10 nm in diameter were synthesized from acetone, ferrocene, and thiophene, whereas CNT fibers containing mainly single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) 1–1.5 nm in diameter were obtained from methane, ferrocene, and sulfur. The differences in the products arose from the anti-agglomeration effects of the sulfur atoms, which were adsorbed onto the surfaces of the iron catalyst particles, as indicated by direct experimental evidence. A model for the interplay between sulfur atoms and the iron catalyst particles was proposed based on these results, and experimental confirmation of this model was sought by modulating the sulfur injection time into the reactor at different temperatures. This simple experimental modification was used to control the majority of CNTs in the CNT fibers synthesized from SWCNTs, through DWCNTs, and finally to multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs), with corresponding

            The specific strength of a carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber can be estimated to be much higher than its real value when the linear density of the fiber is measured using the vibroscopic method. This is because CNT fibers are not made of a single fiber, as assumed in the standard ASTM procedure, but rather have a hierarchical structure composed of CNTs and CNT bundles. Based on careful investigation, a new procedure using the vibroscopic method is proposed to drastically reduce the probability of erroneous results and provide a more reliable tool to investigate the mechanical properties of one-dimensional nanostructured fibers.},

Separate and simultaneous physical (roller pressing) and chemical methods (cross-linking) were tested to confirm each method’s effects on the CNTF strength. By reducing the fraction of pores, roller pressing decreased the cross-sectional area from 160 μm2 to 66 μm2 and increased the average load-at-break from 2.83 ± 0.25 cN to 4.41 ± 0.16 cN. Simultaneous injection of crosslinker and roller pressing augmented the cross-linking effect by increasing the infiltration of the crosslinker solution into the CNTF, so the specific strength increased from 0.40 ± 0.05 N/tex to 0.67 ± 0.04 N/tex. To increase the strength by cross-linking, it was necessary that the size of the pores inside the CNTF were reduced, and the infiltration of the solution was increased. These results suggest that combined physical and chemical treatment is effective to increase the strength of CNTFs.},

              The seed-mediated growth strategy of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) inside carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers is demonstrated to greatly improve their mechanical and electrical properties and provide a function for catalytic applications. The resulting Au NP@CNT nanocomposite fibers exhibit 100\% knot efficiency, catalytic activity and considerably enhanced modulus, tensile strength, and electrical conductivity from 7 GPa, 109 MPa and 1300 S cm

	abstract = {High interfacial resistance and unstable interphase between cathode active materials (CAMs) and solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in the composite cathode are two of the main challenges in current all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). In this work, the all-phosphate-based LiFePO4 (LFP) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) composite cathode is obtained by a co-firing technique. Benefiting from the densified structure and the formed redox-active Li3–xFe2–x–yTixAly(PO4)3 (LFTAP) interphase, the mixed ion- and electron-conductive LFP/LATP composite cathode facilitates the stable operation of bulk-type ASSBs in different voltage ranges with almost no capacity degradation upon cycling. Particularly, both the LFTAP interphase and LATP electrolyte can be activated. The cell cycled between 4.1 and 2.2 V achieves a high reversible capacity of 2.8 mAh cm–2 (36 µA cm–2, 60 °C). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the asymmetric charge/discharge behaviors of the cells are attributed to the existence of the electrochemically active LFTAP interphase, which results in more sluggish Li+ kinetics and more expansive LFTAP plateaus during discharge compared with that of charge. This work demonstrates a simple but effective strategy to stabilize the CAM/SSE interface in high mass loading ASSBs.},

Our results show that while no major morphological changes are observed at 10–2 Pa and only coarsening is induced at 10 Pa, environmental pressures of 300 and 750 Pa lead to the formation of typically sintered LATP electrolytes. Furthermore, the use of pressure as an additional parameter in sintering allows the grain size and shape of electrolyte particles to be controlled.},

            Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) technique has been used to perform a wide range of in situ and operando studies. While most studies are based on the sample contrast change in the liquid, acquiring high qualitative results in the native liquid environment still poses a challenge. Herein, we present a novel and facile method to perform high-resolution and analytical electron microscopy studies in a liquid flow cell. This technique is based on removing the liquid from the observation area by a flow of gas. It is expected that the proposed approach can find broad applications in LPTEM studies.},

            High energy density electrochemical systems such as metal batteries suffer from uncontrollable dendrite growth on cycling, which can severely compromise battery safety and longevity. This originates from the thermodynamic preference of metal nucleation on electrode surfaces, where obtaining the crucial information on metal deposits in terms of crystal orientation, plated volume, and growth rate is very challenging. In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) is a promising technique to visualize and understand electrodeposition processes, however a detailed quantification of which presents significant difficulties. Here by performing Zn electroplating and analyzing the data via basic image processing, this work not only sheds new light on the dendrite growth mechanism but also demonstrates a workflow showcasing how dendritic deposition can be visualized with volumetric and growth rate information. These results along with additionally corroborated 4D STEM analysis take steps to access information on the crystallographic orientation of the grown Zn nucleates and toward live quantification of in situ electrodeposition processes.},
